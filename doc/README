Physical and numerical models:

- The target fluid is an ideal gas.
- Normalization: p = rho T (ideal gas's equation of state).
- Geometry: 3-D rectangular box.
- Boundary condition: Periodic in all directions.
- 2nd-order finite difference method for the spatial derivative.
- 4th-order Runge-Kutta method for time integration.


Input:

- See 'sample.namelist'.

Output:

- AVS field data (time sequence). Use AVS/Express to analyze these.
- Slice data (also time sequence). You need special analyzer for this.
- These data are saved in files in the current directory.
- You can control file names, such as '_data_avs.000.fld' etc. See sample.namelist


To analyze the output data:

- For 2-D slice plane visualizaiton: 
Follow the README in slice_grapher.


- For 3-D slice plane visualizaiton: 
- Use AVS/Express for *.fld files in job.




For your experiments:


- Change "Viscosity" in the input data (namelist).
- Change grid size (NX,NY,NZ) in code/constants.f90
- Change the external driving force in code/solver.f90.
      - THE_FORCE value
      - Region of the driving force in 'set_drive_force_field'.
- Put another force source region to make a pair of colliding rings.
